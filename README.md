**Project Lead**: @pratheekrebala 

## About Public Files

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), per [47 CFR 73.3526] (https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.3526) requires that commercial television states keep a political file that documents the details the advertising activity of political candidates on their channel. The public files extensively detail the transactions that political campaigns and ad-buyers have with the TV station including price per spot, detailed schedules and program information. Some stations also choose to provide additional information about the targeted demographic and Cost Per-Engagement (CPE) information.

A few sample PDF files have been provided in the `samples` directory.

## Project Goals

This project aims to develop a pipeline for fetching, cleaning and parsing the data on political ad spending available from the FCC's Public Files.
